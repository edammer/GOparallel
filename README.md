# GOparallel
Uses BaderLab's monthly updated .GMT formatted ontology gene lists for Fisher exact enrichment into differential or co-expression or other user-supplied gene lists.
GO.obo file download is required for redundant term pruning.
WGCNA modules can be co-clustered for relatedness of modules by GO-cellular component terms hit or depleted per signed Z score calculation.

Compatible with the Seyfried systems biology pipeline.

See Instructions below and use R wrapper code to set all needed variables in the global environment before the function call. For 2 input options, Seyfried analysis pipeline should already have been run, or outputs loaded into memory.

Sample input for <a href="https://github.com/edammer/GOparallel/raw/main/PipelineSample-MEGATMT-WGCNA-NatNeurosci2022.RData">WGCNA modules</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/edammer/GOparallel/raw/main/PipelineSample-MEGATMT-ANOVA%2BVolcano-NatNeurosci2022.RData">ANOVA-Tukey table + volcano settings</a> from pipeline outputs can be downloaded and loaded from .RData files prior to using this wrapper. Outputs will reproduce what is contained in <a href="https://github.com/edammer/GOparallel/blob/main/GOparallel-SampleOutput.zip">this .zip</a>. These sample analysis inputs use the 8619 fully corrected, age, sex, and PMI-regressed protein abundance data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00999-y">Johnson ECB, et al, Nat Neurosci., 2022</a>, processed through the Seyfried Lab systems biology pipeline, of which GOparallel is a late step.

Note the current analysis output samples in the above linked .zip use June 2022 ontologies, much newer compared to those in the publication, which was based on the GO-Elite Ensembl v62+ database.
## **Functional Description**
  - performs hypergeometric overlap with Fisher Exact Test for enrichment p<0.05
    and 5 minimum genes per ontology
  - currently outputs files that can be used as GO-Elite input, not read by this script...
  - outputs Z score barplots for each input list (module, or DiffEx Protein list) across 6 ontology types in the larger GMT files
    available from the Bader Lab website.

## INSTRUCTIONS
  - Download <a href="https://github.com/edammer/GOparallel/raw/main/GOparallel-FET.R">GOparallel-FET.R</a> source, change variables serving as parameters in the wrapper code below and run GOparallel().

  - Input can be:
    1) a .csv file with uniqueIDs (Symbol|otherID(s)...) or species-appropriate gene symbols in columns.
       (Each will be considered as a list of DEPs or module members); specify fileName and have below two flags =FALSE.
       alternately, the input can be a WGCNA kME table output from the Seyfried systems pipeline saved as .csv.
    2) cleanDat, net$colors (or NETcolors) variables from Seyfried systems biology pipeline loaded in memory     (modulesInMemory=TRUE)
    3) ANOVA/T-Test statistics table with <a href="https://github.com/edammer/parANOVA">Seyfried volcano code block (plotVolc function)</a> data structures loaded in memory       (ANOVAgroups=TRUE)

    #3 Uses ANOVAout data in memory or passed to GOparallel(), and previous volcano selection criteria for DEx gene products if the plotVolc() function was already run from the <a href="https://github.com/edammer/parANOVA">parANOVA.dex source</a>.

  - Outputs are:
    1) Z score barplots with min z ~1.96 (p<0.05) calculated from Fisher Exact Test ORA (one-tailed) p values. One barplot is
       created for each input list (module, or up DEGs, or down DEGs for each ANOVA/T-test comparison in ANOVAout).
    2) Tab-separated .txt table of all lists' signed Zscores (each list is a column) for all ~13000 ontologies.
       Z scores are converted from p values as two-tailed p values, since each enrichment and depletion p value is calculated
       to get signed Z scores (less than zero if depleted more than by chance).  I.e. the conversion to Z uses p/2.
    3) Tab-separated .txt table of all lists' Enrichment p values
    4) Tab-separated .txt table of all lists' Enrichment Benjamini-Hochberg corrected FDR values.
    5) (optional) GO:Cellular Component ontologies with at least one highly significant list enrichment are coclustered
       in a heatmap of signed Zscores across all lists. Works well with WGCNA module input.                   (cocluster=TRUE)

## Other Notes
Requires R packages: piano, WGCNA, curl, doParallel, rvest, ontologyIndex, NMF, stringr.
The piano package (documentation <a href="https://rdrr.io/bioc/piano/">here</a>) can be installed from bioconductor, enabling ontology enrichment analysis on gene sets.

The function for fisher exact test calculation used within GOparallel is derived from a similar function in the piano package, with its dependencies, but further calculates the p values of both enrichment and depletion so that we have signed Zscores available.
##
.GMT standard tab-separated format databases are downloaded after scraping available file links from http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/current_release/
for any of the available species there. According to <a href="http://baderlab.org/GeneSets">the site's documentation</a>, the 3 core GO ontology types are updated monthly, and additional curated pathways are collected from various sources, e.g. the Molecular Signatures (MSig) C2 database, Reactome, wikipathways, etc., which are updated less regularly.

In interactive sessions run from an R console, needed ontology database download will commence of [SPECIES]_GO_AllPathways_with_GO_iea_[DATE]_symbol.gmt from the BaderLab download website online folder structure after interactive user input to select the species. The interaction is skipped if the .GMT file specified in GMTdatabaseFile variable exists.  Note that repetitive bulk downloads of large files during working hours can trigger a ban of the downloader's IP.
  

If GO redundant term removal is enabled, ontologyIndex package will be loaded and the full go.obo file downloaded from <a href="http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go.obo">http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go.obo</a> if not already present as specified in the GO.OBOfile variable.
